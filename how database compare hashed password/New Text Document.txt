It uses PHP's built-in password_verify() function.

How does it work? Magic. No seriously, magic. On topics of cryptography, you will at some point be forced to choose between two possibilities:

    Accept that it's magic, and get on with your life
    Become a professional cryptographer

Anyway, password_hash() returns different values each time because it appends a random string (a "salt") to the password. The salt is actually contained in the output hash.

If the same password is hashed with the same salt, you will always get the same output. Therefore password_verify() looks at the stored hash, extracts the salt, and then hashes the given password with that same salt.
